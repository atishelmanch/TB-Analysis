baseline:

b_charge: sum of WF samples in a fixed (taken from cfg) window.
b_slope: a pol1 b_slope*x + K is fit to the baseline.
b_rms: RMS of the sample inside the baseline window.

amplitude:

maximum: max sample value.
amp_max: interpolated amp max (pol2 fit, number of sample used is specified in the cfg).
fit_ampl: amplitude extracted from a template fit.

charge:

charge_sig: sum of WF samples inside a window defined in the cfg
charge_tot: sum of |WF samples| over the whole digitizer window.

time:

time_maximum: bare time of max sample
time: for normal WF is the time computed with a CFD method, in the process amp_max is used as amplitude information. 
For NINO this variables is computed with a leading edge method (threshold set in the cfg, roughly ~40% of amp_max).
time_chi2: chi2/ndf of the linear interpolation used to reconstruct the time (both CFD and LED).
time_max: time estimated from pol2 interpolation.
chi2_max: chi2 of the pol2 interpolation.
fit_time: time extracted from the template fit.
fit_chi2: chi2/ndf of the template fit.

hodo:

hodoX, hodoY: 4 branches (2 in X, 2 in Y).

others:

spill, event, run, start_time: copied from the raw tree.
for each channel a name is specified in the cfg file, a branch with this name is created for each of the channels. 
Each branch hold the index corresponding to the channel inside the tree, so for example in order to plot the amplitude of the reference MCP one should do:
reco_tree->Draw("amp_max[MCP1]")
